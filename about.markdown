  Hi, I'm Christian, and I've been doing embedded systems stuff for a little over 8 years, mostly in renewable energy and energy storage. Welcome to my personal site! Have a look around, but understand that this is a work in progress. I intend to post about some projects I'm working on, as well of some general thoughs on the embedded industry, and ya'know, whatever. If you wish to hire me, I am available for full time employment as well as contract jobs. I am located near Sacramento, CA.
