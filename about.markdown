 Hi, I'm Christian, and I've been doing embedded systems stuff for just about 10 years, mostly in renewable energy and energy storage, and a wee bit of robotics.
It's my life's ambition to make things that improve the quality of life for humans and non-humans, while mimimizing said thing's negative impacts.
I am keenly aware of the fact that everything I've ever built, and ever will build will eventually end up in a landfill. Many things I've designed already are. I've made it my goal to maximize the good a thing can provide before it finds it's way to it's final resting place.

So... Welcome to my personal site!

Have a look around, but understand that this is a work in progress. I intend to post about some projects I'm working on, as well of some general thoughs on the embedded industry, and ya'know, whatever. If you wish to hire me, I am available for full time employment as well as contract jobs. I am located near Sacramento, CA.

Should you feel so inclined, have a look at my [resume](/resume/Resume-Christian-Stewart-rev1.pdf) or browse on over to my [portfolio](/portfolio/index.html).
